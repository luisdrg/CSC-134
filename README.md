# CSC-134
Hello, my name is Luis Rivera, and welcome to my CSC-134 class repository! This repository showcases some of the projects I've worked on, as well as some of my interests in programming and web development.

## About Me
I am passionate about learning new technologies and solving problems through programming. Throughout my studies, I've worked with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, including C, Java, and web technologies like React and Firebase. My focus has been on both game development and web-based applications, and I enjoy exploring new tools that help me build more efficient and innovative solutions.

## Projects

### 1. Akari Game (C, Java, and MIPS Assembly)
- **Description**: I developed a game called *Akari* (also known as *Light Up*) in C, Java, and MIPS Assembly. The objective of the game is to place lights in a grid to illuminate all the cells while following certain rules and constraints.
- **Technologies**: C, Java, MIPS Assembly
- **Key Features**:
  - Implemented the game logic and algorithms for solving the puzzles.
  - Designed an interactive user interface for both the C and Java versions of the game.
  - Transformed the C game implementation into MIPS assembly, learning low-level programming concepts and optimization techniques in the process.


### 2. MoodNotes Website
- **Description**: A web-based platform I created that allows users to track and record their mood over time. It integrates with Firebase for real-time database functionality and user authentication.
- **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript(React), Firebase
- **Key Features**:
  - Firebase authentication for user accounts.
  - Real-time database to store and display user mood logs.
  - Interactive interface to visualize mood data over time.

### 3. Swagger UI Docs Tech Talk
- **Description**: I gave a technical talk on Swagger UI documentation, focusing on how to use Swagger to create interactive API documentation and streamline the development process.
- **Technologies**: Swagger, API documentation
- **Key Features**:
  - Detailed explanation of Swagger UI and how it helps developers visualize and interact with APIs.
  - Demonstrated how to generate Swagger docs from an API and customize them for specific use cases.

## Learning and Development Goals
Throughout this course, I aim to further develop my skills in software engineering, particularly in areas such as:
- Building robust applications with clean, maintainable code.
- Exploring new programming paradigms and frameworks.
- Improving my ability to present technical topics to a diverse audience.
